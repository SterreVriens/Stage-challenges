# JSON-Treasure-Hunt
JSON Treasure Hunt Challenge

Find the treasure! Write a script that shows the exact path of the booty!

Booty is located at "dailyprogrammer". This is hidden deep in the challenge1.txt and challenge2.txt files!

### So, now what
You will have to write a script that runs trough the JSON objects and finds the given word. Show the full path of the word.

I.e. For challenge 1 the path should be: "axvjf > tskgrsi > 0 > ozr > 0 > 1 > 0 = dailyprogrammer"
